Utero is a work in progress Julia-based library with the goal of facilitating experimentation with alternative machine learning paradigms. As such, Utero is programmed with readability in mind as opposed to performance. Since it was written in Julia, it is still sufficiently fast. It currently includes the necessary tools for multivariate differentiable programming.
